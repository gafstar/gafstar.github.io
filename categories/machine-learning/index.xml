This data comes from UCI Machine Learning Repository. From analyzing this data,
I believe there are some insights that can be applied to other companies
strategy in acquiring new clients. The data is related with direct telemarketing
campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were
based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was
required, in order to access if the phone call will result for a long term
deposit or not. This analysis is based only on 10% of the overall dataset used
by S. Moro et al., 2014.

The purpose of this post it to understand how to apply XGBoost to a binary
classification problem. In this post we are going to see how to apply XGBoost
classifier algorithm to an adult data set downloaded from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult&#34;
  &gt;UCI Machine Learning Repository&lt;/a
&gt;. XGBoost is an optimized gradient boosting open source library knows for its
flexibility and portability. It is also a popular algorithm for machine learning
competitions for structured or tabular dataset. In
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/&#34;&gt;Kaggle competitions,&lt;/a&gt; it is the number one
choice for tabular dataset.
